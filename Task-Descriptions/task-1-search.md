# 🔍 Task 1: Searching for Parks with Filters

## 🎯 Why Task 1?

Task 1 (**Searching for parks based on features**) is **the foundation** of the Park
Platform.  
It allows users to quickly **find the right park based on their needs**.

**Once users can search for parks**, additional features like:  
✅ **Viewing Ratings & Reviews**  
✅ **Safety Issue Reporting**  
✅ **Community Event Planning**  
can be built **on top of this core functionality**.

## 🖥️ How It Works

Users can **search for parks** by:
✔ **Typing a park name or location**  
✔ **Using interactive map navigation**  
✔ **Applying filters** (e.g., pet-friendly, wheelchair accessible, restrooms)

### 🔍 **Search Filter Options**

| Filter Option         | Purpose                                   |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Playground            | Find parks with child-friendly play areas |
| Pet-friendly          | Identify parks that allow dogs            |

| Trails                | Find parks with hiking or walking paths   |
