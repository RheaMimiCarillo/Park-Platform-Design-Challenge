# 🏞️ Park Platform Design Challenge

## 📌 Project Overview

Neighborhood parks serve as important gathering spaces for communities, yet **finding accurate
and up-to-date park information is difficult** due to fragmented sources. Our project aims to *
*centralize park information** and offer a **user-friendly digital platform** where users can
search for parks, review amenities, report issues, and organize events.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Provide an **all-in-one platform** for discovering and reviewing parks.
- Enable users to **search for parks** based on their needs (**playgrounds, pet-friendly,
  wheelchair accessibility**).
- Allow community members to **report safety and maintenance issues**.
- Support event **organization and participation** in local parks.

## 🔍 User Research & Findings

### **👥 Interview Participants**

We interviewed a diverse set of **park-goers** to understand their challenges and expectations:

- **👨‍👩‍👧 Parents** – Frequently visit parks with their children but struggle to find parks
  with appropriate playsets.
- **👵 Seniors** – Need safe walking trails and seating but lack up-to-date park information.
- **👦 Young Adults** – Use parks for **leisure and social events** but face difficulties
  organizing gatherings.

### **📝 Key Takeaways**

✔ **Finding the right park is frustrating** due to outdated information.  
✔ **Safety & cleanliness concerns** are common, but reporting options are limited.  
✔ **Users rely on word-of-mouth recommendations**, which are unreliable.  
✔ **Event planning is difficult**, as parks often lack scheduling tools.
