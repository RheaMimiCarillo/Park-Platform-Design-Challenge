# Park Platform Design Challenge

Teams are tasked with creating initial interface designs for a neighborhood park information-sharing platform. They need to brainstorm and sketch two radically different concepts for a mobile and web interface that solves the problems and supports the tasks outlined in the project proposal.

Activity Flow:

1. Introduction (10 minutes):

Split into teams of 5 people each. 
Note: You will be working with the same team members throughout the project iteration.
Let's go over the project details: Neighborhood Parks.pdf
Our goals: creating two different interface designs - one for mobile and one web that support 4 of the 6 listed tasks.
Remember: our goal is to generate rough sketches of interface designs, focusing on how the tasks will be performed.

2. Team Brainstorming (20 minutes):

Focus on:
Design Differentiation: Each team should create two radically different designs. For example, one might lean towards a minimalist design, while another might focus on a rich, detailed interface.
Key Features: Incorporate task-specific features like ratings, search, safety reporting, event organization, etc.
Design Priorities: Each team member can propose ideas, focusing on their role in the user journey.
Think about how different user types (families, seniors, youth) will navigate the platform.

3. Sketching Phase (30 minutes):

Create rough sketches of the mobile and web interface. Focus on key elements that support the tasks:
Task 1: Searching for parks with specific features (e.g., playgrounds, pet-friendly).
Task 2: Viewing reviews and ratings for parks.
Task 3: Find accessible (safe, quality amenities, accessibility features like wheelchair access, benches, ramps, handrails...) parks.
Task 4: Finding a pet-friendly and clean park.
Task 5: Reporting safety issues or maintenance concerns.
Task 6: Searching for events or organizing park-based functions.
Ensure both the mobile and web versions are distinct from each other but still maintain consistent branding or core functionality.
Key Aspects to Sketch:
Home page layout with search and categories (e.g., location-based or feature-based).
Detailed park pages with reviews, ratings, and reports.
A map interface with pins indicating park locations.
Reporting tool UI for safety/maintenance issues.
Event scheduling and announcement tools.

4. Group Discussion and Iteration (20 minutes):

Pair up with other team to discuss strengths & weakness of the initial sketches.
Each team will get 10 minutes to explain their sketches and receive feedback
Submission Guidelines:

Scan and upload your initial sketches (5 pts per design = 20 pts)
Note: Sketches should be eligible and easy to understand 
A document that includes both strength & weakness feedback received from other team (5 pts each = 10 pts)
Note: Feedback should be clear, understandable and grammatically correct.
Next Week:

Iterate and refine the designs based on group feedback, making sure to balance aesthetics and functionality.
Move on to digital interface designs.
