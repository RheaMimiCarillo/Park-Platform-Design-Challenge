# Park Platform Design Challenge

We focused on task 1 in our final prototype because it establishes a basis for park searching, allowing users to find parks in their local area. Once users can search for parks, then more options and features can be added, including ratigs, reports, makinng events, etc. This task is essential because it helps user quickyl find parks to match their specific needs. 

Our final design incooperated feedback including more accesibiliy features, larger icons, and more clear fucntionalities. We added a speak to talk microphone, keyboard, and cleared icons. 

As mentioned above, to imporve user expreince, we made icons more clear and larger, as well as ensuring the icons meanings were very quite. We added many interactive features, including interactives maps and searches to allow users to find their best mathces based on proximity and other filters.
