# 🌳 Park Platform Design Challenge

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Park Platform Design Challenge** aims to create a **centralized platform** for
neighborhood park information.  
Users can **search for parks with specific features**, read ratings, report safety issues, and
find events.  
This project was developed as part of a **computer science design challenge**, with a focus on
**usability, accessibility, and user-driven feedback**.

## 🎨 Initial Design Sketches

Before developing the **digital prototype**, we explored **low-fidelity sketches** to map out
user flows.

## 🔍 Selected Task: **Park Search & Filters (Task 1)**

### **Why We Focused on This Task**

✅ **Foundation of the platform** – Searching is the **first step** before reviews, reports, or
events.  
✅ **Allows customization** – Users can **filter parks by features (playgrounds, pet-friendly,
etc.)**.  
✅ **Enables accessibility enhancements** – **Voice search, larger icons, and simplified UI**
improve usability.

## 🧠 Research & Brainstorming

This project was developed through an **iterative design process**, incorporating **user
research, brainstorming, and peer feedback**.

📄 **Full Brainstorming Notes:** [
`Research/Week7-8-Brainstorming.pdf`](Research/Week7-8-Brainstorming.pdf)

### 🔍 Short-Listed Tasks:

✅ **Task 1: Park Search & Filters** (Playgrounds, pet-friendly, accessibility)  
✅ **Task 2: Ratings & Reviews** (Consolidating feedback from different sources)  
✅ **Task 5: Safety Reporting** (Quick issue submission for park conditions)  
✅ **Task 6: Event Planning** (Organizing park-based activities)

### 📝 Key Insights from Brainstorming:

- **Search Bar + Filters**: Allow users to filter parks based on features (playgrounds, trails,
  restrooms).
- **Park Profiles**: Each park should have **user-submitted features & images**.
- **Safety Reporting**: Enable anonymous issue reports (trash, broken equipment, vandalism).
- **Events Tab**: Users can submit or view **community park events** (cleanups, gatherings,
  sports).

## 📢 Feedback & Iterations

Throughout the design process, we **iterated based on peer feedback**:  
✔ **Larger icons & clearer UI**  
✔ **Voice search microphone for accessibility**  
✔ **More intuitive navigation & map updates**

📌 **Feedback Summary:** See [`Feedback/peer-review-notes.md`](Feedback/peer-review-notes.md)
