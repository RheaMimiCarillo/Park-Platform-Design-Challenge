Digital Feedback: 

We chose Task 1 as it was the best standalone option. All the other tasks seemed to require integration with additional features, whereas Task 1 could function independently by itself. It also provided the most flexibility in terms of implementation and potential enhancements without starting or using other tasks. The task was also the most important one, as searching for different features of a park is desirable for a person searching for them.
To improve the user experience, we focused on:
Simple navigation uses buttons to define and differentiate the functions of different pages.
Accessibility features, such as a microphone for voice search.
Filtering options, including pet-friendly locations, wheelchair accessibility, restrooms, and other user-specific needs.
Overall, we received positive feedback on our design, with no major changes needed. However, we considered making some icons more specific and clear in representing their functions. Additionally, we received feedback about enhancing accessibility features, including speech-to-text functionality (a microphone) and a pop-up keyboard. One key point raised by the other group was a need for clarification on where the data for our platform originates. This is valuable feedback that we may incorporate into future iterations of our design.
