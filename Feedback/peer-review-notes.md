# 📝 Peer Review & Feedback Summary

## 🔍 Overview

Throughout the **Park Platform Design Challenge**, we received valuable **peer feedback**
during multiple phases of the project:  
1️⃣ **Initial Sketch Review** – Feedback on early Web & Mobile sketches.  
2️⃣ **Live Digital Prototype Review (Canva)** – Feedback on interactive elements.

Our **primary focus** was **Task 1 (Searching for Parks with Features)** as it is **a
foundational feature** that other functionalities (ratings, reporting, events) can be built
upon.

## 🎥 Live Digital Prototype Feedback (Canva)

### **Why We Chose Task 1**

Our peer reviewers **agreed that Task 1 (Searching for Parks)** was the **best standalone
feature** because:

- **All other tasks require integration** with other features.
- **Searching is the primary user need**, and refining this **enhances the entire experience**.
- **Provides flexibility** for future features such as **ratings, safety reports, and events**.
