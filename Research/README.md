# 496 Park Platform Design Challenge Notes/Brainstorming

## Short-Listed Tasks

Task 1: Looking for a park with a playground for my little brother.. To find information I
would search on google or look at google maps to try and determine if the park has a proper
playground. Searching for parks with specific features (playground, pet-friendly, etc)

Task 2: Looking on different websites for reviews and ratings on parks. People will often make
google searches to find ratings and reviews or sometimes Yelp if the park they are looking for
is available there. This will be a consolidated way to look at parks specifically. Viewing
reviews and ratings for parks.

Task 5: Utilize a quick safety reporting feature while at the park to report instances of
unsafe behavior / poor park conditions, such as public indecency or cleanliness issues.
Reporting safety issues or maintenance concerns.

Task 6: Search for public events planned in a specific park or organize public events within
parks, leveraging online platforms or community resources. Searching for events or organizing
park-based functions.

Key Aspects to Sketch:
Home page layout with search and categories (e.g., location-based or feature-based).
Detailed park pages with reviews, ratings, and reports.
A map interface with pins indicating park locations.
Reporting tool UI for safety/maintenance issues.
Event scheduling and announcement tools

Goal: Make rough sketches of interface designs, focusing on how the tasks will be performed.
Incorporate features like raings, search, safety reporting, even organization, etc. Consider
how different user types will navigate the platform.

Notes:
Search bar and filters, take location or park name, with filter options for playground,
pet-friendly, restrooms, trails, seating,etc
Map integration, map with icons showing parks that match search criteria
Park profiles, each park page lists its amenities, images, and user submitted tags confirmed
features
